# goal-seek

goal-seek is a javascript library that can be used to solve for the value of an independent variable: "x"; of a function: "f(x)"; such that f(x) equals some defined goal. In other words: do you know the desired output of a function but not the input to yield such an output? If so, then use this goal seek!

Currently, this goal seek uses [Steffensen's Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffensen%27s_method) to find the root of the error. 

## Usage

The package exports two error types, the function parameter type and one function, `goalSeek` as a default export:

```typescript
export const IsNanError = TypeError('resulted in NaN');
export const FailedToConvergeError = Error('failed to converge');

export type Params = {
  fn: (...inputs: any[]) => number;
  fnParams: any[];
  percentTolerance: number;
  maxIterations: number;
  maxStep: number;
  goal: number;
  independentVariableIdx: number;
};

const goalSeek = ({
  fn,
  fnParams,
  percentTolerance,
  maxIterations,
  maxStep,
  goal,
  independentVariableIdx,
}: Params): number => {
  ...
}

export default goalSeek;
```

The `goalSeek` function takes one object argument with the following keys:

1. `fn` - the function, "f(x)" that is being evaluated.
2. `fnParams` - an array of parameters that are to be used as inputs to `fn`.
3. `percentTolerance` - the acceptable error range to the stated goal. For example, if `goal: 100` and `percentTolerance: 1`, then any values in the range [99, 101] will be accepted as correct (Â± 1% of 100).
4. `maxIterations` - the maximum number of attempts to make.
5. `maxStep` - the maximum magnitude step size to move the independent variable `x` for the next guess.
6. `goal` - the desired output of the `fn`.
7. `independentVariableIdx` - the index position of the independent variable `x` in the `fnParams` array.

To use the function, for example, with a simple linear equeation:

```javascript
  let x = 10;
  const fn = (x: number): number => x + 2;
  const fnParams = [x];

  try {
    const result = goalSeek({
      fn,
      fnParams,
      percentTolerance: 0.01,
      maxIterations: 1000,
      maxStep: 10,
      goal: 100,
      independentVariableIdx: 0
    })
  
    // result => 98
  } catch(e) {

  }
```

## Errors

This library will throw one of two errors: `IsNanError` or `FailedToConvergeError`.

### IsNanError

`IsNanError` is thrown whenever the result of `fn` returns a value that is not a number. For example, if `fn` is `Math.log`, and the value `-1` is input `goalSeek` with throw `IsNanError`.

### FailedToConvergeError

`FailedToConvergeError` is thrown when no acceptable independent variable can be found. For example, if `fn` is `x * x` and goal is `-1` the library will fail to converge and throw `FailedToConvergeError`.


## Examples
  
```javascript
import goalSeek from 'goal-seek';

const fn = (x,y,z) => x * y * z;
const fnParams = [4,5,6];

try {
  const result = goalSeek({
    fn,
    fnParams,
    percentTolerance: 1,
    maxIterations: 1000,
    maxStep: 1,
    goal: 140,
    independentVariableIdx: 2
  });

  console.log(`result: ${result}`);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('error', e);
}

// result: 7
