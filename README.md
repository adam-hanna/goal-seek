# goalSeek.js

goalSeek.js is a javascript library that can be used to solve for the value of an independent variable: "x"; of a function: "f(x)"; such that f(x) equals some defined goal. In other words: do you know the desired output of a function but not the input to yield such an output? If so, then use this goal seek!

Currently, this goal seek uses Steffensen's Method to find the root of the error. 
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffensen%27s_method

## Functions:
<dl>
  <dt><h3>1. goalSeek(paramatersObject)</h3>
  <dd><h6>Parameters</h6>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Func</b>: the name of the function in question.</li>
    <li><b>This</b>: [SITUATIONAL] define a "this" object which can be used within the function. Omit if your function does not need to reference "this" (e.g. this.a + b).</li>
    <li><b>aFuncParams</b>: the parameters that are used as the input to Func. This must be an array. If you do not want to provide an intial guess, just pass "null" (or any other falsy type) for your independent variable in question. If no guess is provided, a random value between 0 and 1 will be used. If no suitable initial value is found after 100 trys, the function will exit and return null.</li>
    <li><b>oFuncArgTarget {Position: integer, propStr: string}</b>: an object to locate the independent variable within aFuncParams which is to be sought. Position is the position of the independent variable within the parameters array. propStr is only needed for independent variables that are within objects, otherwise it can be omitted. It is the location of the independent variable's key in dot notation.</li>
    <li><b>Goal</b>: the desired output of the function.</li>
    <li><b>Tol</b>: [OPTIONAL] the magnitude of the tolerance for an acceptable output. e.g. if the desired output is 100, a 0.1 tolerance would accept any output within the inclusive range {99.9: 100.1}. The default if no argument is given is the magnitude of 0.1% of the goal.</li>
    <li><b>maxIter</b>: [OPTIONAL] the maximum number of iterations to perform. The default if no argument is given is 1,000 iterations.</li>
  </ul>
  <dd><h6>Return</h6>
  <dd>The function will return the value of the independent variable such that the function is within the tolerance of the goal, or it will return null if no such value was found within the maximum allowed number of iterations. 
  <dt><h3>2. Support functions</h3>
  <dd>There are two support functions within this library which help in getting and setting values within objects. They are setObjVal(Obj, propStr, Value) and getObjVal(Obj, propStr).

## Examples:
  
```html
<!--HTML-->
<script>
  //generic example
  function fx1(i1, i2, i3) {
    return i1 * i2 * i3;
  };

  //example with an object input
  function fx2(i, o) {
    return i * o.a * o.b.b1;
  };

  //example with the use of "this"
  function oTest(a) {
    this.a = a
  };

  oTest.prototype.bar = function(b) {
    return this.a + b;
  };

  var foo = new oTest(1);



  console.log(goalSeek({
    Func: fx1, 
    aFuncParams: [4, 5, 6],
    oFuncArgTarget: {
      Position: 2
    },
    Goal: 140,
    Tol: 0.01,
    maxIter: 1000
  }));

  //example for no guess provided
  console.log(goalSeek({
    Func: fx2, 
    aFuncParams: [4, {a: 5, b: {b1: null}}],
    oFuncArgTarget: {
      Position: 1,
      propStr: "b.b1"
    },
    Goal: 140,
    Tol: 0.01,
    maxIter: 1000
  }));

  console.log(goalSeek({
    Func: foo.bar,
    This: foo,
    aFuncParams: [3],
    oFuncArgTarget: {
      Position: 0
    },
    Goal: 8,
    Tol: 0.01,
    maxIter: 1000
  }));
