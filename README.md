# goalSeek.js

goalSeek.js is a javascript library that can be used to solve for an independent variable of a function ("x") such that f(x) equals some defined goal. In other words: do you know the output of a function but not the input to yield such an output? If so, then use this goal seek!

The function in question must use an object as the only input to the function. The object can contain many keys and subdocuments; however, currently, the independent variable must not be in a subdocument! This will be fixed in a future release.

Currently, this goal seek uses Steffensen's Method to find the root of the error.

## Functions:
<dl>
  <dt><h3>goalSeek(Func, oFuncArgs, sFuncArgsTarget, Goal, Tol, maxIter)</h3>
  <dd><h6>Arguments</h6>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Func</b>: the name of the function in question.</li>
    <li><b>oFuncArgs</b>: the object that is used as the unput to Func. Please note that the this object must contain a guess for the independent variable in question.</li>
    <li><b>sFuncArgsTarget</b>: the key within oFuncArgs that is to be sought. This input must be a string.</li>
    <li><b>Goal</b>: the desired output of the function.</li>
    <li><b>Tol</b>: [OPTIONAL] the magnitude of the tolerance for an acceptable output. e.g. if the desired output is 100, a 0.1 tolerance would accept any output within the inclusive range {99.9: 100.1}. The default if not argument is given is the magnitude of 0.1% of the goal.</li>
    <li><b>maxIter</b>: [OPTIONAL] the maximum number of iterations to perform. The default if no argument is given is 1,000 iterations.</li>
  </ul>
  <dd><h6>Return</h6>
  <dd>The function will return the value of the independent variable such that the function is within the tolerance of the goal, or it will return null if no such value was found within the maximum allowed number of iterations. 
</dl>

## Examples:
  
```html
<!--HTML-->
<script>
	function fx1(o) {
		return o.x * o.a * o.b;
	};

	function fx2(o) {
		return o["someThing.x"] * o["someThing.a"] * o["anotherThing.b"];
	};

	function fx3(o) {
		return o.x * o.someThing.a * o.anotherThing.b;
	};

	var oFuncArgs3 = {
		x: 2,
		someThing: {
			a:4
		},
		anotherThing: {
			b: 5
		}
	};

	var sFuncArgsTarget3 = "x";

	console.log(goalSeek(fx1, {x:2, a:4, b:5}, "x", 140, 0.01, 1000));
	console.log(goalSeek(fx2, {"someThing.x":2, "someThing.a":4, "anotherThing.b":5}, "someThing.x", 140, 0.01, 1000));
	console.log(goalSeek(fx2, oFuncArgs2, sFuncArgsTarget3, 140, 0.01, 1000));
</script>

<!--Will Return-->

## Todo:
<dl>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>Allow independent variables to be within subdocuments of oFuncArgs.</li>
